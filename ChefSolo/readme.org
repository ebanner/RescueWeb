* Introducing Chef Solo
** Chef is an automated tool for provisioning and deploying servers
*** Provisioning is ensuring correct software and configurations
*** Deployment means putting a given revision of code up
** In its native state, Chef is a client/server based package
*** Extensive authentication required
*** Deploying machine runs client/configured machines attach
*** Pull oriented
** Chef Solo instead runs from a local directory full of files
*** Copy over a Chef configuration
*** Run Chef Solo and the recipes specified are run
*** Push oriented
** Downsides of Chef (for us)
*** Written (including recipes) in Ruby
*** Has a particular view of how an application is deployed
**** Far from simple

* Getting Started
** Copy the ChefSolo subtree into your project. 
*** Directory structure is simple(ish)
